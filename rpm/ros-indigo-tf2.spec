%description
tf2 is the second generation of the transform library, which lets the user keep
track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains the relationship
between coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time, and lets the
user transform points, vectors, etc between any two coordinate frames at any
desired point in time.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
